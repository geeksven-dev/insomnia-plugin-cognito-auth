### Setup
#### Files
Just put this src in your insomnia plugin folder and create a subfolder named as you like (e.g. 'cognito-auth') located at 
`~/Library/Application Support/Insomnia/plugins`

#### Environment
Create an environment in Insomnia and add the following params:
```
"username": "<username>",
"password": "<password>",
"userPoolId": "<user_pool_id>",
"clientId": "<client_id>",
"host": "<host>"
```
### How it works
On each request the plugin will intercept the execution and lookup for existing `accessToken` and `identityToken`in the 
context store. If there is none that can be used a cognito authentication will be triggered via aws-amplify. On success 
the header will be set.
